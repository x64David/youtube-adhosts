# youtube-adhosts
This list is experimental, used for testing, This Adlist is most likely to break some YouTube videos, use the other one that I have.

This list is dedicated to most suspicious domains from *.googlevideo.com

If you have any issues with the list, you should try removing it, while I'm testing it on YouTube.

Update: I have made a little bit of testing, it looks like it breaks some YouTube videos, or maybe its just YouTube's fault trying to load an ad before loading the video ifself, Though this could be easily fixed by removing this adlist either refreshing YouTube (Web Broswer), Restarting the app (Android, iOS, Smart TV's).
